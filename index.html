<h1>My Bio</h1>
<body>


    <p>
     My name is Kelan Moffatt abd i currently attend the UCI Coding Bootcamp. Before i came here I used to be an EMT but, the pay was not that great and I needed a change. Before I committed to the bootcamp I needed to make sure. I travelled to many places across Asia and beyond to think long and hard.
